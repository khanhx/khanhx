## **👋 Hi there**

I'm a solution-oriented developer, lifelong learner, and adventurer with 6+ years of experience in the software industry.

*"We can't truly solve a problem until we're able to see it thoroughly"* – This philosophy has guided me through creating impactful software solutions that solve real-world problems. It's incredibly rewarding to see how my code can positively impact people's lives.

Throughout my career, I've focused on creating software solutions, designing systems, and leading development teams. My expertise lies in SaaS applications (Messaging automation, Virtual office) and blockchain technologies (payments, card banking, digital wallets, and banking integrations).
