## **👋 Hi there**

I’m a solution-oriented developer, a lifelong learner, and an adventurer with 6-year experience in the software industry.

*"We can't truly solve a problem until we're able to see it thoroughly"* – That’s my favorite quote. I've had some projects in my career where I've created successful software that helps people solve their real-life problems. It feels great knowing you can bring positive impacts to people around with your codes :)

Through my career for all these years, I have been working on creating software solutions, designing and leading teams and development. Most of my experience is in SaaS (Messaging automation, Virtual office) and block chain industries (payments, card bank, digital wallets and banking integrations).
