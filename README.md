## 👋 Hi there

I'm a **solution-oriented Senior Software / Blockchain Engineer** with **8+ years of experience** in the software industry.

> *“We can’t truly solve a problem until we’re able to see it thoroughly.”*

This philosophy has guided me through building impactful software systems that solve real-world problems. I’m particularly passionate about **Bitcoin-native architectures**, **MPC wallets**, and **financial infrastructure** that balances security, scalability, and user custody.

Throughout my career, I’ve focused on designing systems, leading development efforts, and turning complex research into production-ready solutions across **SaaS** and **blockchain** domains.
